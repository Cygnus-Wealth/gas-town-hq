Implement directly. The PRIME.md has been updated — read it first. Run unit tests locally, skip E2E (CI handles it). Pipe npm install to /tmp/install.log. Commit EARLY after edits, push, check CI. The 3 exact fixes are in the bead description.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nEXACT ROOT CAUSE (confirmed by 2 independent polecats, all 197 tests pass with fixes):\n\nTHREE bugs causing zero USD values:\n\n1. useAccountSync: EVM native token price NOT calling fetchPrice(chainConfig.symbol) like Solana/SUI paths do. Fix: add the fetchPrice() call, same pattern as other chains.\n\n2. useAccountSync (~line 163-164): ERC20 tokens hardcoded to priceUsd: 0, valueUsd: 0 with no price fetch. Fix: add fetchPrice() for each ERC20 symbol, compute valueUsd = balance * price.\n\n3. useProgressiveAssetLoading (~line 287-289): Disabled with bare 'return;' and comment '// TEMPORARILY DISABLED to debug performance issue'. Even when enabled, uses simulated random prices. Fix: remove the return, replace simulated prices with real AssetValuator calls via dynamic import, add symbol deduplication.\n\nPROCESS: Run unit tests locally (npm test -- --run). Do NOT run E2E locally — CI handles that. Commit early, push to branch, verify CI passes.

DECIMAL CONVERSION — useAccountSync may not be converting raw balances from getAllBalances to human-readable amounts. Check if EvmIntegration returns raw or converted values and ensure the app handles both correctly.\n\n2. DUPLICATE ACCUMULATION — USDT shows 'MetaMask (3 accounts)' source but only 1 wallet connected. useAccountSync is likely calling the balance fetch multiple times and accumulating instead of replacing.\n\n3. NON-DETERMINISTIC — Different total every page load. Race conditions in useAccountSync or useProgressiveAssetLoading when processing ERC20 results.\n\n4. SPAM FILTERING — Even if EvmIntegration returns all tokens, the app should filter out zero-value or unpriced tokens from display. Add a filter to hide tokens where valueUsd is 0 or Error, or where balance is effectively zero.\n\n5. DISPLAY — 74 assets is too many. Default should hide spam. The 'Show zero balances' toggle exists but spam tokens with non-zero (worthless) balances still show.\n\nThis depends on EvmIntegration fixing the fetch side (en-xjc3).

Implement directly. Read PRIME.md first — unit tests locally, E2E via CI only. Pipe npm install to /tmp/install.log. COMMIT EARLY before running tests. The app shows 1.6 trillion USD instead of ~490.

These were just modified in PR #4 to add pricing — the unit conversion is likely missing.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nUser reports wallet shows ~$490 worth of tokens but the app displays $1.6 trillion USD.\n\nThis is almost certainly a decimal precision bug in the valuation calculation. The most likely cause: raw token amounts (in wei for EVM, lamports for Solana) are being multiplied by the USD price WITHOUT dividing by 10^decimals first.\n\nExample: 0.1 ETH = 100000000000000000 wei. If multiplied by $2000 without decimal conversion, you get $200,000,000,000,000,000 — trillions.\n\nFiles to investigate (these were just modified in PR #4):\n- src/hooks/useAccountSync.ts — where balances are fetched and valueUsd is computed\n- src/hooks/useProgressiveAssetLoading.ts — where prices are applied to balances\n\nCheck:\n1. Are native token balances being converted from wei/lamports to human-readable amounts BEFORE multiplying by price?\n2. Are ERC20 token balances being divided by 10^token.decimals before valuation?\n3. Is the balance field on BalanceAggregate already in human-readable form or raw units?\n4. Check the data-models BalanceAggregate type — what units does the balance field expect?\n\nThe fix in PR #4 added fetchPrice() calls but may not have handled the unit conversion correctly.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"CygnusWealthApp/polecats/rust","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-16T20:38:04.443319196-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-16T20:59:00.941504356-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-16T20:59:00.941504356-07:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

Implement directly. The getAllBalances/getMultiChainAllBalances from ev-9lg has critical bugs. See bead description for all 6 issues. Key problems in YOUR code: (1) ERC20 balances not divided by 10^token.decimals before returning, (2) no spam/scam token filtering — need allowlist or minimum-value filter, (3) possible race conditions causing non-deterministic results and duplicate accumulation, (4) multi-chain fetch only returning Ethereum. Fix the EvmIntegration side. Commit early, unit tests locally.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nThe ev-9lg ERC20 token balance feature (just merged in Wave 2) has multiple critical bugs. User connected wallet 0x08ff8b099dcc50e212c998731b34a548826e1969.\n\nMetaMask shows: $481.93 total, ~15 real tokens across chains\nApp shows: $68,590,359,033.77 total, 74 assets (most spam), Ethereum only\n\nOBSERVED BUGS:\n\n1. DECIMAL HANDLING BROKEN — USDT shows balance 17,154,691,715.5846 in app vs 26.968 in MetaMask. Raw wei/smallest-unit values are not being divided by 10^decimals before display. This was supposedly fixed in ValueCell but the ERC20 fetch path clearly isn't converting.\n\n2. SPAM TOKEN INCLUSION — App shows 74 tokens including obvious spam/scam airdrops: 'Reward Token - Claim at https://stUSD.live', 'Ethereum Games (ETHG) 2000000', 'QuantumAI (QAI)', 'yRise.Finance', 'AI Chain Coin (AICC) 17500', 'Apu Pepe (PAP)'. MetaMask filters these out. Need token allowlist or spam detection.\n\n3. DUPLICATE/ACCUMULATING BALANCES — USDT row shows Source as 'MetaMask (3 accounts)' but only 1 wallet is connected. The fetch is accumulating results across multiple RPC calls or running multiple times.\n\n4. NON-DETERMINISTIC RESULTS — Different total balance on every page load. Suggests race conditions in the ERC20 discovery/fetch pipeline.\n\n5. SINGLE CHAIN ONLY — All 74 tokens show Chain=Ethereum. MetaMask shows assets across Ethereum, Base, BSC. The multi-chain ERC20 fetch isn't working.\n\n6. PRICE ERRORS — Most tokens show $0.00 price and 'Error' for value. AssetValuator can't price unknown/spam tokens, which is expected, but these shouldn't be shown.\n\nThe root cause is likely in EvmIntegration's new getAllBalances/getMultiChainAllBalances from ev-9lg, AND in how CygnusWealthApp's useAccountSync calls it. Both rigs may need fixes.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"EvmIntegration/polecats/obsidian","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-17T08:45:37.386122076-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-17T09:28:14.396483584-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T09:28:14.396483584-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"en-xjc3","depends_on_id":"en-wisp-4j5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T08:46:09.63494087-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}
