The 3 exact fixes are in the bead description.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nEXACT ROOT CAUSE (confirmed by 2 independent polecats, all 197 tests pass with fixes):\n\nTHREE bugs causing zero USD values:\n\n1. useAccountSync: EVM native token price NOT calling fetchPrice(chainConfig.symbol) like Solana/SUI paths do. Fix: add the fetchPrice() call, same pattern as other chains.\n\n2. useAccountSync (~line 163-164): ERC20 tokens hardcoded to priceUsd: 0, valueUsd: 0 with no price fetch. Fix: add fetchPrice() for each ERC20 symbol, compute valueUsd = balance * price.\n\n3. useProgressiveAssetLoading (~line 287-289): Disabled with bare 'return;' and comment '// TEMPORARILY DISABLED to debug performance issue'. Even when enabled, uses simulated random prices. Fix: remove the return, replace simulated prices with real AssetValuator calls via dynamic import, add symbol deduplication.\n\nPROCESS: Run unit tests locally (npm test -- --run).

Implement directly. ARCHITECTURE REVIEW: The user questions whether RPC infrastructure types (UserRpcEndpoint, UserRpcConfig, PrivacyConfig, RpcProviderType extensions) belong in data-models (the shared domain contract). The en-25w5 implementation already put RpcProviderConfig there. Evaluate strictly from DDD: shared kernel scope, infrastructure vs domain concerns, bounded context autonomy. If the placement is wrong, say so and define the correct location. If justified, explain why. Output to mayor/rig/en-1mg1-rpc-types-placement-analysis.md.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nARCHITECTURE REVIEW REQUEST from Mayor/User.\n\nThe en-tfkn directive places new RPC infrastructure types (UserRpcEndpoint, UserRpcConfig, PrivacyConfig, extended RpcProviderType) in data-models (Contract domain). The user questions whether this is correct.\n\nThe concern: data-models is the shared ubiquitous language for DOMAIN data — canonical business types like Asset, Portfolio, WalletConnection, etc. RPC provider configuration is an INFRASTRUCTURE concern (which endpoints to hit, circuit breaker tuning, privacy rotation). Putting infrastructure config types in the domain contract package may violate separation of concerns.\n\nContext: The en-25w5 implementation already placed RpcProviderConfig, ChainRpcConfig, RpcEndpointConfig, and RpcProviderType in data-models because the config flows from CygnusWealthApp → EvmIntegration/SolIntegration. So there's precedent. But precedent doesn't mean it was the right call.\n\nEVALUATE AND JUSTIFY:\n1. Should en-tfkn's new types (UserRpcEndpoint, UserRpcConfig, PrivacyConfig) go in data-models?\n2. Should the EXISTING en-25w5 RPC types (RpcProviderConfig, etc.) even be in data-models?\n3. If not data-models, where? Options: a dedicated shared infrastructure package, inline in each consuming rig, or a new shared types package.\n4. What does DDD say about infrastructure configuration crossing bounded context boundaries via the shared kernel (data-models)?\n\nBe direct. If the current placement is wrong, say so and define the correct location. If it's justified, explain why with DDD reasoning.

Investigate directly. Analyze the cross-chain DeFi architecture question: should DeFi protocol integration live inside chain-specific libraries (evm-integration, sol-integration) or in a separate defi-integration bounded context? Consider: ev-82k already added Beefy+Aave to evm-integration. Solana DeFi (Marinade, Raydium, Jupiter, Orca) and SUI DeFi (Cetus, Turbos, Scallop) are not yet scoped. Also determine if po-e31 (DeFi aggregation) should be multi-chain from the start. Read existing architecture specs, domain contracts, and the current evm-integration DeFi implementation. Produce a clear architectural recommendation. Do NOT write code — produce analysis only. Do NOT use EnterPlanMode.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nTwo architectural decisions needed before Wave 4 (po-e31 DeFi aggregation):\n\n## 1. DeFi Scope Beyond EVM\nev-82k added EVM DeFi (Beefy, Aave) to evm-integration. What about:\n- Solana DeFi: Marinade, Raydium, Jupiter, Orca — currently SolIntegration only covers SPL tokens, staking, NFTs\n- SUI DeFi: Cetus, Turbos, Scallop — no SUI integration rig exists yet\n- Should po-e31 (DeFi aggregation in PortfolioAggregation) be designed for multi-chain DeFi from the start?\n\n## 2. Structural Question: DeFi in chain integrations vs. separate library?\nOption A: DeFi stays in chain-specific integration libs (evm-integration, sol-integration, future sui-integration). Each lib owns its chain's DeFi protocols alongside token/balance fetching.\n\nOption B: DeFi becomes its own bounded context / library (e.g. defi-integration) that is chain-aware but separate from the *-integration packages.\n\nIf Option B: How does a standalone defi-integration library relate to evm-integration, sol-integration, etc.? Does it depend on them? Wrap them? Sit alongside them? Does it share RPC connections or have its own?\n\n## Constraints\n- Must align with existing domain isolation and dependency direction rules\n- Must use DeFi position types from data-models (da-syn)\n- Client-side only, read-only\n- Consider: protocol adapters are chain-specific but DeFi concepts (vaults, lending, LP) are cross-chain\n\nProduce a clear architectural recommendation with rationale.

Implement directly. Read PRIME.md first — unit tests locally, E2E via CI. Pipe npm install to /tmp/install.log. COMMIT EARLY. The ERC20 token display has bugs on the app side: duplicate accumulation in useAccountSync, no spam token filtering, race conditions causing different balance each load. See bead for all 5 issues. Focus on the app-side fixes — EvmIntegration is being fixed separately.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nThe app's integration with EvmIntegration's new ERC20 token fetching has bugs on the app side:\n\n1. DECIMAL CONVERSION — useAccountSync may not be converting raw balances from getAllBalances to human-readable amounts. Check if EvmIntegration returns raw or converted values and ensure the app handles both correctly.\n\n2. DUPLICATE ACCUMULATION — USDT shows 'MetaMask (3 accounts)' source but only 1 wallet connected. useAccountSync is likely calling the balance fetch multiple times and accumulating instead of replacing.\n\n3. NON-DETERMINISTIC — Different total every page load. Race conditions in useAccountSync or useProgressiveAssetLoading when processing ERC20 results.\n\n4. SPAM FILTERING — Even if EvmIntegration returns all tokens, the app should filter out zero-value or unpriced tokens from display. Add a filter to hide tokens where valueUsd is 0 or Error, or where balance is effectively zero.\n\n5. DISPLAY — 74 assets is too many. Default should hide spam. The 'Show zero balances' toggle exists but spam tokens with non-zero (worthless) balances still show.\n\nThis depends on EvmIntegration fixing the fetch side (en-xjc3).

Implement directly. This is P0 — design the enterprise-wide decentralized RPC provider strategy. We just hit rpc.ankr.com/solana returning 403 in production. Our current approach of hardcoding free public endpoints is unreliable and contradicts our decentralization principles. Evaluate POKT Network, dRPC, and Lava Network as decentralized-first providers. Design multi-provider fallback, user-configurable endpoints, no baked-in API keys, privacy-conscious provider selection. Cover all chains (EVM + Solana). Output architecture spec to mayor/rig/ as markdown. Reference existing fallback chain infrastructure already built. This must be a complete, implementable strategy.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nENTERPRISE-WIDE ARCHITECTURE DIRECTIVE\n\nCurrent state: Integration rigs hardcode free public RPC endpoints (e.g. rpc.ankr.com/solana) that are unreliable — rate-limited, 403-blocked, no SLA. This contradicts our core principles of client-side sovereignty and decentralization. We're dependent on centralized infrastructure providers as single points of failure.\n\nDESIGN a comprehensive RPC provider strategy that covers:\n\n1. DECENTRALIZED-FIRST PROVIDER SELECTION\n   - Evaluate Pocket Network (POKT), dRPC, and Lava Network as primary providers — these are actually decentralized relay networks, not single-company endpoints\n   - POKT: 1M relays/day free, ~30 chains, decentralized node operators stake tokens\n   - dRPC: 50+ independent operators, 95+ chains, censorship-resistant fabric\n   - Lava Network: gateway routing across operators, good as fallback layer\n   - Define selection criteria: decentralization, chain coverage, free tier limits, reliability, latency, privacy (do they log queries?)\n\n2. MULTI-PROVIDER FALLBACK ARCHITECTURE\n   - Build on existing RPC fallback chain infrastructure (already implemented in ev-zwqy, ev-c9h3, so-dgar, cy-ins3)\n   - Define the provider hierarchy: decentralized primary → decentralized secondary → centralized fallback\n   - No single provider should be a SPOF\n   - Circuit breaker and health monitoring integration (already built)\n\n3. USER-CONFIGURABLE RPC ENDPOINTS\n   - Users can bring their own RPC endpoint or API key (sovereignty principle)\n   - Custom endpoint UI in settings\n   - Per-chain endpoint configuration\n   - Validation and health-check of user-provided endpoints\n\n4. NO BAKED-IN API KEYS\n   - Client-side app means any API key is public — never embed keys\n   - Free tiers and keyless access only for default config\n   - User-provided keys stored in encrypted local storage only\n\n5. CHAIN COVERAGE\n   - Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, BSC, Avalanche (EVM)\n   - Solana\n   - Future: any chain we add integration rigs for\n   - Define minimum provider requirements per chain\n\n6. PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS\n   - Which providers log queries? Which don't?\n   - Can we rotate providers to prevent query correlation?\n   - POKT's decentralized model means no single party sees all queries\n\n7. CROSS-DOMAIN CONTRACTS\n   - How does CygnusWealthApp bootstrap RPC config?\n   - How do integration rigs (EvmIntegration, SolIntegration) consume the config?\n   - How does the config flow through PortfolioAggregation?\n   - Update data-models if new types needed\n\n8. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY TARGETS\n   - Max acceptable latency per request type\n   - Fallback switch time\n   - Health check intervals\n   - Circuit breaker tuning\n\nOutput: Architecture spec to mayor/rig/ as markdown.

There are two DeFi discovery paths: (1) wallet token scanning — DeFi receipt tokens (aTokens, mooTokens, stETH, LP tokens) show up as ERC20s in the wallet and need to be recognized/enriched, and (2) contract state querying — farmed/staked positions that leave the wallet and must be found by querying protocol contracts directly. Design how both paths integrate: token scanner enrichment vs independent contract queries, deduplication between the two paths, and a DeFi token registry for receipt token recognition. Update the en-9qon architecture document with dual-path discovery design. This blocks Wave 4. Do NOT write code. Do NOT use EnterPlanMode.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nev-82k added protocol-specific adapters (Beefy, Aave) to evm-integration. The en-9qon architecture recommendation assumed protocol adapters as the primary DeFi discovery mechanism. But there are actually TWO discovery paths that must work together:\n\n## Path 1: Wallet Token Scanning (passive)\nMany DeFi positions appear as ERC20/ERC721 tokens in the user's wallet:\n- Vault receipts (mooTokens, yTokens)\n- Lending tokens (aTokens, cTokens)\n- Liquid staking derivatives (stETH, rETH, mSOL)\n- LP tokens (Uniswap V2 LP, Uniswap V3 NFTs)\n\nThe existing ERC20 token discovery (ev-9lg, cy-ehma) may already be picking these up but showing them as unknown tokens with no USD value. These need to be RECOGNIZED as DeFi positions and enriched with protocol context (underlying assets, APY, exchange rate).\n\n## Path 2: Contract State Querying (active)\nSome DeFi positions leave the user's wallet entirely:\n- Farmed/staked LP tokens — deposited into farm contracts, tracked via internal mappings\n- Locked/vesting positions — held by vesting contracts\n- Leveraged positions / perps — pure contract state, no receipt token\n- Some liquidity pools without receipt tokens\n\nThese are invisible to wallet token scanning. Must query specific protocol contracts (e.g., MasterChef.userInfo(pid, address)) to discover them.\n\n## Architecture Question\n1. How should these two paths integrate? Should the token scanner feed into protocol adapters for enrichment (Path 1), while protocol adapters also do independent contract queries (Path 2)?\n2. How does evm-integration's existing ERC20 discovery (ChainRegistry from cy-ehma) coordinate with the DeFi protocol adapters from ev-82k to avoid duplicate positions?\n3. Should there be a DeFi token registry that maps known receipt token addresses to their protocols for Path 1 enrichment?\n4. Update the en-9qon architecture document with dual-path discovery design.\n\nThis is blocking Wave 4 — po-e31 needs to know what shape DeFi data arrives in from the integration layer.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"EnterpriseArch/polecats/furiosa","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-17T15:54:59.510124614-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-17T16:01:55.761280997-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T16:01:55.761280997-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"en-v99r","depends_on_id":"en-wisp-52az","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T15:55:39.40582562-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}

The most likely cause: raw token amounts (in wei for EVM, lamports for Solana) are being multiplied by the USD price WITHOUT dividing by 10^decimals first.\n\nExample: 0.1 ETH = 100000000000000000 wei. If multiplied by $2000 without decimal conversion, you get $200,000,000,000,000,000 — trillions.\n\nFiles to investigate (these were just modified in PR #4):\n- src/hooks/useAccountSync.ts — where balances are fetched and valueUsd is computed\n- src/hooks/useProgressiveAssetLoading.ts — where prices are applied to balances\n\nCheck:\n1. Are native token balances being converted from wei/lamports to human-readable amounts BEFORE multiplying by price?\n2. Are ERC20 token balances being divided by 10^token.decimals before valuation?\n3. Is the balance field on BalanceAggregate already in human-readable form or raw units?\n4.

Fix the EvmIntegration side. Commit early, unit tests locally.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nThe ev-9lg ERC20 token balance feature (just merged in Wave 2) has multiple critical bugs. User connected wallet 0x08ff8b099dcc50e212c998731b34a548826e1969.\n\nMetaMask shows: $481.93 total, ~15 real tokens across chains\nApp shows: $68,590,359,033.77 total, 74 assets (most spam), Ethereum only\n\nOBSERVED BUGS:\n\n1. DECIMAL HANDLING BROKEN — USDT shows balance 17,154,691,715.5846 in app vs 26.968 in MetaMask. Raw wei/smallest-unit values are not being divided by 10^decimals before display. This was supposedly fixed in ValueCell but the ERC20 fetch path clearly isn't converting.\n\n2. SPAM TOKEN INCLUSION — App shows 74 tokens including obvious spam/scam airdrops: 'Reward Token - Claim at https://stUSD.live', 'Ethereum Games (ETHG) 2000000', 'QuantumAI (QAI)', 'yRise.Finance', 'AI Chain Coin (AICC) 17500', 'Apu Pepe (PAP)'. MetaMask filters these out. Need token allowlist or spam detection.\n\n3. DUPLICATE/ACCUMULATING BALANCES — USDT row shows Source as 'MetaMask (3 accounts)' but only 1 wallet is connected. The fetch is accumulating results across multiple RPC calls or running multiple times.\n\n4. NON-DETERMINISTIC RESULTS — Different total balance on every page load. Suggests race conditions in the ERC20 discovery/fetch pipeline.\n\n5. SINGLE CHAIN ONLY — All 74 tokens show Chain=Ethereum. MetaMask shows assets across Ethereum, Base, BSC. The multi-chain ERC20 fetch isn't working.\n\n6. PRICE ERRORS — Most tokens show $0.00 price and 'Error' for value. AssetValuator can't price unknown/spam tokens, which is expected, but these shouldn't be shown.\n\nThe root cause is likely in EvmIntegration's new getAllBalances/getMultiChainAllBalances from ev-9lg, AND in how CygnusWealthApp's useAccountSync calls it. Both rigs may need fixes.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"EvmIntegration/polecats/obsidian","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-17T08:45:37.386122076-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-17T09:28:14.396483584-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T09:28:14.396483584-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"en-xjc3","depends_on_id":"en-wisp-4j5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T08:46:09.63494087-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}
