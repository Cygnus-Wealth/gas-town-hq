The broken symlink at node_modules/@cygnus-wealth/asset-valuator points to a nonexistent path. All other @cygnus-wealth packages resolve from npm registry correctly. FIX: 1) Remove broken symlink at node_modules/@cygnus-wealth/asset-valuator. 2) Fix package-lock.json entry to resolve from npm registry like the others (latest published is 0.3.0). 3) Update package.json to ^0.3.0. 4) Run npm install. 5) Verify npm run build succeeds. 6) Verify npm run test:e2e passes (Playwright, 62 tests).\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nE2E tests fail in 3 rigs due to broken @cygnus-wealth/* package resolution.\n\nEvmIntegration: Cannot find @cygnus-wealth/data-models at all.

Rebuild data-models — ensure dist exports match package.json exports map (especially enums/AssetType)\n2. Republish or relink data-models in EvmIntegration and SolIntegration node_modules\n3. Install asset-valuator in CygnusWealthApp\n4. npm install in all 3 consuming rigs\n5.

This is a docs-only architecture research task. Write a recommendation document to a new file. See bead description for full requirements.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nPolecats consistently exhaust their session/context budget before completing the commit+submit cycle when E2E tests are involved. The verification pipeline (npm install ~2min + Playwright browser install ~3min + build + unit tests + 64 E2E tests across chromium+firefox ~5min) takes 9-11 minutes total. Polecats also need time to investigate, implement fixes, and commit. By the time E2E finishes, the session is dead.\n\nEvidence from CygnusWealthApp:\n- chrome polecat (hq-3asww): Needed 0 code changes. Deps already correct. E2E was running at 2m48s into 5m timeout when session died.\n- rust polecat (hq-04rc8): Changed 2 lines in package.json. Build passed, unit tests running when session died.\n- Both polecats did real work but never reached commit+gt done.\n\nThis affects any rig with E2E tests (CygnusWealthApp has Playwright, others have Vitest E2E). The problem will get worse as test suites grow.\n\nNeed an architectural solution. Some options to evaluate:\n1. Split verification: commit first, verify in a separate step (refinery or CI)\n2. Pre-install Playwright browsers in worktree templates\n3. Increase polecat session/context budget for E2E-heavy rigs\n4. Run E2E as a post-merge CI gate instead of pre-commit polecat responsibility\n5. Polecat checkpointing — save progress and resume in a new session\n6. Parallel test execution to reduce wall clock time\n\nThe solution must work within GT's autonomous agent model where polecats are ephemeral and unattended.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"EnterpriseArch/polecats/furiosa","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-16T14:21:21.469305713-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-17T23:23:37.228229271-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T23:23:37.228229271-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hq-47tea","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-ni975","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-16T14:21:58.489442992-07:00","created_by":"mayor"},{"issue_id":"hq-47tea","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-tnam1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-16T16:07:50.393313734-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}

{"id":"hq-hgfjl","title":"Fix missing USD values on portfolio balances","description":"attached_molecule: hq-wisp-e9q7p\nattached_at: 2026-02-16T23:22:05Z\nattached_args: SKIP PLAN MODE. COMMIT EARLY before tests. The exact root cause and fixes are in the bead description. Three bugs in useAccountSync and useProgressiveAssetLoading. Make the edits, COMMIT IMMEDIATELY, then run tests. Do not wait for tests before committing. Previous polecat confirmed all 197 tests pass.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nEXACT ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED (from previous polecat investigation):\n\nTHREE bugs in CygnusWealthApp causing zero USD values:\n\n1. EVM NATIVE TOKEN PRICE HARDCODED (useAccountSync hook)\n   - The EVM path does NOT call fetchPrice(chainConfig.symbol) like the Solana and SUI paths do\n   - Fix: Replace hardcoded value with real fetchPrice() call, same pattern as Solana/SUI paths\n\n2. ERC20 TOKEN PRICES ALWAYS ZERO (useAccountSync hook, ~lines 163-164)\n   - ERC20 tokens always get priceUsd: 0, valueUsd: 0 with no price fetch\n   - Fix: Add fetchPrice() call for each ERC20 token symbol, compute valueUsd from balance * price\n\n3. useProgressiveAssetLoading ENTIRELY DISABLED (~line 287-289)\n   - Has a bare 'return;' statement with comment '// TEMPORARILY DISABLED to debug performance issue'\n   - Even when enabled, it used simulated random prices instead of real data\n   - Fix: Remove the return statement, replace simulated prices with real AssetValuator calls via dynamic import, add symbol deduplication to avoid redundant API calls\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: These are the EXACT fixes needed. Implement them, commit IMMEDIATELY after editing (before running full test suite), then run tests. Previous polecat confirmed all 197 tests pass with these fixes. COMMIT EARLY — do not wait for test results to commit.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"CygnusWealthApp/polecats/rust","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-16T16:21:07.369524192-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-16T17:23:57.594245732-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-16T17:23:57.594245732-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hq-hgfjl","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-e9q7p","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-16T16:21:40.929078142-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}

For each bounded context (DataModels, EvmIntegration, WalletIntegrationSystem, AssetValuator, SolIntegration, RobinhoodIntegration, PortfolioAggregation, CygnusWealthApp), determine:\n\n1. Whether E2E tests are appropriate for that context\n2. What E2E scenarios should be covered (if any)\n3. What test infrastructure is needed (Playwright, mock providers, test fixtures, chain forks, etc.)\n4. How E2E tests interact across bounded context boundaries\n\nContext: Unit tests are now green across most rigs. E2E tests exist in some rigs (CygnusWealthApp has Playwright, EvmIntegration had a failing test:e2e script) but there is no coherent enterprise-wide E2E policy.\n\nIMPORTANT: Document all architectural decisions and standards in the EnterpriseArch repo. This becomes the canonical reference that domain/rig architects follow.\n\nAfter the enterprise policy is defined, it must trickle down — each rig architect should receive guidance and document their rig-specific E2E strategy in their own repo.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"EnterpriseArch/polecats/furiosa","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-14T13:30:25.555981875-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-14T21:26:53.016086216-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T21:26:53.016086216-07:00","close_reason":"Work merged to main — e2e-testing-strategy.md committed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hq-p9nwf","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-0rd2x","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T13:30:51.198975442-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}

Downstream packages like evm-integration use require() (CJS), and Vite dep pre-bundling in CygnusWealthApp fails with: 'No known conditions for . specifier in @cygnus-wealth/data-models package'. FIX: Add 'require' conditions to EVERY export path in package.json exports map. Each entry currently has {types, import} — add a 'require' field pointing to the CJS equivalent. If CJS dist files don't exist, update the tsconfig/build to emit both ESM and CJS. Ensure the package builds cleanly and all tests pass.
