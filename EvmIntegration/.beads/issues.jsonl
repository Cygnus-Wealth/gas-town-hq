WebSocket connection manager with connection pool (one WS per chain per provider tier), lazy establishment, reconnection with exponential backoff (1s base, 30s max, 10 retries), heartbeat (30s ping, 5s pong timeout), and subscription registry.\n\n2. newHeads subscription + block-driven balance refresh. Subscribe to eth_subscribe('newHeads') once per chain, on each new block batch-fetch balances for all tracked addresses via eth_getBalance.\n\n3. logs subscription for ERC-20 Transfer events filtered to tracked addresses (from OR to). Use keccak256('Transfer(address,address,uint256)') topic.\n\n4. Polling fallback with PollManager. When WS fails after max retries, fall back to 30s HTTP polling. Continuously attempt WS recovery every 60s while polling. Emit same events as WS path (transport-agnostic).\n\n5. Extend to all EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, BNB, Avalanche, Fantom). WS endpoints per provider documented in architecture doc Section 6.\n\nExport SubscriptionService interface: subscribeBalances, subscribeTokenTransfers, subscribeNewBlocks, subscribePendingTransactions, subscribeContractEvents, unsubscribe, getSubscriptionStatus. Return SubscriptionHandle with onData/onError/onStatusChange callbacks.\n\nDomain events to emit: WEBSOCKET_CONNECTED, WEBSOCKET_DISCONNECTED, WEBSOCKET_RECONNECTING, WEBSOCKET_FAILED, SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED, SUBSCRIPTION_REMOVED, TRANSPORT_FALLBACK_TO_POLLING, TRANSPORT_RESTORED_TO_WS, LIVE_BALANCE_UPDATED, LIVE_TRANSFER_DETECTED, LIVE_BLOCK_RECEIVED.\n\nFollow TDD.

Switch all service methods from string[] addresses to AddressRequest[] — AddressRequest has accountId, address, chainScope fields.\n2. Account-attributed result types — all query results (balances, transactions, tokens, NFTs, DeFi positions) carry accountId for attribution. Use AccountBalanceList, AccountBalance, AccountError pattern from the spec.\n3. Address deduplication in batch queries — when AddressRequest[] contains duplicate addresses (same address, different accountIds): group by unique (address, chainId), execute one RPC query per unique pair, fan out results to all associated accountIds.\n4. Subscription event attribution — SubscriptionEvent gets new accountIds: AccountId[] field (plural, since same address may belong to multiple connections). Subscription fires once per on-chain event, portfolio layer resolves account attribution.\n5. Update BlockchainIntegrationContract — getBalances, getTransactions, getTokens, getNFTs, getDeFiPositions all accept AddressRequest[] and return account-attributed results. getBatchBalances for batch optimization. subscribeToUpdates accepts AddressRequest[].\n\nUpdate @cygnus-wealth/data-models dependency to latest version with the new identity types.

Implement directly. Phase 3 of RPC fallback chain (per en-25w5). Implement shared RPC infrastructure: (1) CircuitBreaker — state machine CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN per (chainId, provider), 5 failures/60s triggers OPEN, 30s timeout, 3 successes to close. (2) TokenBucketRateLimiter — per-endpoint rate limiting from rateLimitRps config. (3) RpcFallbackChain — ordered endpoint traversal with circuit breaker + rate limiter, cache fallback, 30s total timeout. (4) HealthMonitor — background ping per provider (60s interval, eth_blockNumber for EVM). (5) ProviderMetrics — P50/P95/P99 latency, rolling 5-min error rate. Retry: maxAttempts=2, exponential backoff, skip on 403. Use RpcProviderConfig types from latest @cygnus-wealth/data-models. Export all classes for sol-integration to import. Follow TDD. Do NOT use EnterPlanMode. Do NOT run E2E tests locally.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nRPC fallback chain Phase 3 (per en-25w5 directive). Depends on Phase 1 (data-models types).\n\nImplement shared RPC infrastructure classes. Per the directive, these could be a shared package or duplicated. Implement in evm-integration first (sol-integration can import or duplicate):\n\n- CircuitBreaker: state machine (CLOSED→OPEN→HALF_OPEN→CLOSED) per (chainId, provider). 5 failures/60s → OPEN, 30s timeout, 3 successes to close.\n- TokenBucketRateLimiter: per-endpoint rate limiting based on rateLimitRps config\n- RpcFallbackChain: ordered endpoint list, circuit breaker + rate limiter integration, cache fallback, total timeout enforcement (30s default)\n- HealthMonitor: background ping per provider per chain (60s interval), lightweight calls (eth_blockNumber for EVM)\n- ProviderMetrics: latency tracking (P50/P95/P99), error rate (rolling 5-min window)\n\nRetry within endpoint: maxAttempts=2, exponential backoff. Skip retry on 403/auth failures.\nFollow TDD.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"EvmIntegration/polecats/obsidian","owner":"jacob@s56.net","created_at":"2026-02-17T16:44:49.522231212-07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-17T17:06:59.700913716-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T17:06:59.700913716-07:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ev-zwqy","depends_on_id":"ev-wisp-d537","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T16:53:02.257786132-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}
