Ensure all existing tests still pass after migration\n\nPhase 2 — Add E2E tests:\n4. Create vitest.e2e.config.ts with node env, 15s timeout, 2 retries\n5. Implement scenarios: price fetch for known asset (P0), batch price fetch (P1), currency conversion (P1), API unavailable fallback (P1), stale price detection (P2)\n6. Use recorded API responses for CI, allow live calls for nightly runs\n7. Standardize npm script: test:e2e\n8. Document E2E strategy in repo ARCHITECTURE.md\n9.
