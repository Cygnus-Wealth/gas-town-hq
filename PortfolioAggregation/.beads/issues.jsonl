Implement directly. SubscriptionOrchestrator per en-p0ha architecture directive (step 7). Coordinates subscriptions across evm-integration and sol-integration.

Do NOT use EnterPlanMode.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nImplement SubscriptionOrchestrator per en-p0ha architecture directive (step 7).\n\nSubscriptionOrchestrator coordinates subscriptions across evm-integration and sol-integration SubscriptionServices:\n\n1. Lifecycle management: When portfolio-aggregation receives tracked addresses from wallet-integration, create subscriptions via integration SubscriptionServices.\n\n2. Event normalization: Chain-specific subscription events arrive in different formats. Normalize to unified PortfolioUpdateEvent domain events.\n\n3. Deduplication: Multiple events can fire for the same logical update (e.g., Transfer log + balance change on newHeads). Deduplicate within 500ms window per address per chain.\n\n4. Debouncing per-chain: Solana 2s windows, Polygon 5s windows, Ethereum/L2s no debounce needed (12s+ block times).\n\n5. Incremental aggregation: On normalized event, fetch updated data for affected asset only (not full portfolio refresh), merge with cached data, emit incremental PortfolioUpdateEvent.\n\nAdd to PortfolioAggregationContract: subscribeToLiveUpdates(): LiveSubscriptionHandle, getLiveConnectionStatus(): Map\u003cChainId, SubscriptionStatus\u003e.\n\nDEPENDENCY: This requires WebSocket SubscriptionService to exist in evm-integration and sol-integration. Those are being implemented in parallel (ev-* and so-* beads). If the interfaces aren't published yet, implement against the expected interface and mock in tests.\n\nFollow TDD.

Implement: (1) Call getDeFiPositions() on all chain integrations in parallel (same scatter-gather as getBalances). (2) Deduplicate cross-chain positions using deduplicationKey. (3) Aggregate DeFi value into portfolio totals — supply positions add, borrow positions subtract. (4) Request pricing for underlying assets via asset-valuator. (5) Partial failure strategy — one chain failing doesn't block others. (6) Coordinate with getTokens() to prevent double-counting receipt tokens.
