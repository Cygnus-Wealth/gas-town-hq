Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck.

You cease to exist after this step.\n\n**Self-Cleaning Model:**\nOnce you run `gt done`, you're gone. The command:\n1. Pushes your branch to origin\n2. Creates an MR bead in the merge queue\n3. Nukes your sandbox (worktree removal)\n4. Exits your session immediately\n\n**Run gt done:**\n```bash\ngt done\n```\n\nYou should see output like:\n```\n✓ Work submitted to merge queue\n  MR ID: gt-xxxxx\n  Source: polecat/\u003cname\u003e\n  Target: main\n  Issue: po-yu1\n✓ Sandbox nuked\n✓ Session exiting\n```\n\n**What happens next (not your concern):**\n- Refinery processes your MR from the queue\n- Refinery rebases and merges to main\n- Refinery closes the issue\n- If conflicts: Refinery spawns a FRESH polecat to re-implement\n\nYou are NOT involved in any of that. You're gone. Done means gone.\n\n**Exit criteria:** Work submitted, sandbox nuked, session exited.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-14T07:38:43.688459298-07:00","updated_at":"2026-02-14T07:38:43.688459348-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"po-wisp-ypp","depends_on_id":"po-wisp-0cq","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-14T07:38:43.706070938-07:00","created_by":"mayor"},{"issue_id":"po-wisp-ypp","depends_on_id":"po-wisp-xcc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T07:38:43.717582251-07:00","created_by":"mayor"}],"ephemeral":true}
