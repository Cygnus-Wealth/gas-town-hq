Implement directly with TDD. This is Phase 2 (P0) of multi-wallet multi-account architecture (en-fr0z). Update @cygnus-wealth/data-models to latest version first. Reference EnterpriseArch/mayor/rig/en-fr0z-multi-wallet-multi-account-architecture.md sections 1 and 3. Unit tests only, no E2E. START CODING IMMEDIATELY.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nPhase 2 of en-fr0z (multi-wallet multi-account architecture). Depends on Phase 1 (da-x33l, now merged in data-models).\n\nIMPLEMENT:\n1. Account accumulation model — on connectWallet(), store initial accounts from eth_requestAccounts. On accountsChanged, ADD new accounts to the list (never replace). Track isActive flag for currently selected account in provider.\n2. Watch address management — addWatchAddress, removeWatchAddress, updateWatchAddress. WatchAddress entries are independent of wallet connections. AccountId format: watch:{checksummedAddress}.\n3. Account group CRUD — createAccountGroup, updateAccountGroup, deleteAccountGroup. Groups reference AccountIds from any connection or watch addresses.\n4. Session persistence with schema versioning — persist WalletConnections + WatchAddresses + AccountGroups to encrypted local storage. schemaVersion field (version 2 for new model). On restore: re-request accounts from provider, merge with persisted list, mark stale accounts.\n5. Updated WalletConnectionContract — all commands and queries from en-fr0z spec section 3 (connectWallet, disconnectWallet, setConnectionLabel, setAccountLabel, setAccountChainScope, removeAccount, addManualAccountToConnection, watch address commands, group commands, all queries, all events).\n6. Updated WalletIntegrationContract — getTrackedAddresses returning TrackedAddress[], getTrackedAddressesByChain, getTrackedAddressesByWallet, getTrackedAddressesByGroup, getAccountMetadata. Events: onAddressAdded, onAddressRemoved, onAddressChainScopeChanged.\n7. Multi-provider conflict resolution — same address in multiple connections gets distinct AccountIds. Both tracked independently.\n\nUpdate @cygnus-wealth/data-models dependency to latest version with the new identity types. See EnterpriseArch/mayor/rig/en-fr0z-multi-wallet-multi-account-architecture.md sections 1, 3 for full spec.
